\title{Riboflavin Production Data}
\description{
This dataset contains measurements of riboflavin (vitamin B2) production by Bacillus subtilis, a Gram-positive bacterium commonly used in industrial fermentation processes. The dataset includes
\eqn{n = 71} observations with \eqn{p = 4088} predictors, representing the logarithm of the expression levels of 4088 genes. The response variable is the log-transformed riboflavin production rate.

\format{
\describe{
\item{y}{Log-transformed riboflavin production rate (original name: \code{q_RIBFLV}). This is a continuous variable indicating the efficiency of riboflavin production by the bacterial strain.
}
\item{x}{A matrix of dimension \eqn{71 \times 4088} containing the logarithm of the expression levels of 4088 genes. Each column corresponds to a gene, and each row corresponds to an observation (experimental condition or time point).

\details{
The riboflavin dataset is a high-dimensional dataset commonly used in statistical research, particularly in the fields of bioinformatics and systems biology. It was originally collected to study the genetic regulation of riboflavin biosynthesis in Bacillus subtilis. The data were generated using DNA microarray technology to measure gene expression levels under various experimental conditions.
